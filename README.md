# Experiment-11

## Theory:
A class is an object creation blueprint. 
Creating a Class: In C++, a class is a user-defined type that combines functions (methods) and data (attributes) into a single unit. As instances of the class, objects are created using it as a blueprint. Encapsulation and abstraction are two object-oriented concepts that are made possible by classes.
Use or Procedure Within a Class: Functions that work with the data members of a class are called methods. They have access to both public and private class members and define the activities that objects of the class can carry out.
In class, both private and public variables Private members are only allowed to access materials within the classroom, whereas public members can access materials outside of it. Interaction with the class's data is permitted for public members, while private members
